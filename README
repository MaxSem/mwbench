mwbench is a set of shell scripts to quickly test MediaWiki for performance
regressions. It creates a MW checkout, installs it and imports some real-life
pages from Wikipedia. For performance test, it spawns a local nginx instance
then makes requests to it.

Instructions:
1) run install.sh
2) run bench.sh
3) scratch your head


If something goes wrong, run clean.sh then see above.
